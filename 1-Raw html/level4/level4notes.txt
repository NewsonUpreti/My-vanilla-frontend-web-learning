lists ul(ul stands for unordered list) we can give the types inside the ul tag like square and circle but type is recommended to use by css to avoid conflict with html. and li tag
ol(ordered list tag) we can use the ordered list tag in order to make the list ordered by using numbers and I like roman numbers
to display a list of contents using html

table tag to make a table and display the icons in the table we can use border and give the size of the border margins

tr tag means table row
td tag means table data
th tag means table header

We can use the caption tag to give the caption to the table given 

we use thead and tbody tag inside the table to specify the contents which one is the header and which one is the body contents
its a way of wrapping the content. Where there are multiple tables its useful to design accordingly using these tags by wrapping.

if we use colspan tag inside the header the header will take 3 td or table data which means the colspan will help us same data cover the multiple colums 2 or 3 or many more

forms using form tag to make a form design to be filled up and take the input from the user

we use input tag inside the form tag to place the input type like text and placeholder which text is seen in blank form
in the input tag along with the type we also use value name and ID which is really important to make as a identifier
We combine the input tag inside a label tag to make the identity for ="specificname"
Id is like roll number which belongs only to a specific one
name inside the input tag like the type radio we should specify different id for the different input but name must be same while using the radio so that at a time only one radio button will be inputted like choose your gender male or female
We use label for each input so that whenever we press the actual text instead of the radio button the label is all over the text and selection will be made as it will make the task user friendly.... Whatever is in the for id must be in the id inside the input tag
while using the input tag in the form we can also use class in the input tag to specify the class where lot of element can be contained as a similar, We can also give more than one class by giving the spaces in between, class are specially used for grouping of the elements

just like input we can enter the textarea tag with specified rows and columns to take the user review like stuffs
