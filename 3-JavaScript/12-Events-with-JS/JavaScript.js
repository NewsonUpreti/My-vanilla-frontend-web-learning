console.log("This page is all about events in JavaScript");
//Event is a signal that user inputs any kind of action like click hover scroll type and so on.

function togglehide(){
   let button = document.getElementById('btn');
   let paragraph = document.getElementById('para');
}

// way of adding function to the html and running it on the javascript
// for example on the button;;
// {/* <button id= btn onclick=togglehide()> hide/show </button> */}
//  In the above code the onclick is the event in which we can also write onmouseover and so on. and togglehide is the function which is used to me given action from the javascript
