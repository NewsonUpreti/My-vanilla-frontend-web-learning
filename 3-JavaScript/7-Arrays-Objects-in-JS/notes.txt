types of primitive variables.
  let myVar=12;
        let myVar2="String";
        let myvar3=true;
        let myvar4=null;
        let myVar5 = undefined; This is the default value of a variable

Anything created except the primitive are known as objects.
eg: Arrays, objects....
Example of an object:
let employee = {
            name: "string",
            salary : 10,
            channel:"codeSon",
            channel2: "programmingSon",
        }
        In the above case, employee is the object which contains all the informations inside the braces {  }

Arrays in JS:

Example of an array:
let names = [1,2,3,4,"Jason"];
  where names[0] is 1, names[1] is 2 and so on..
  Arrays in Js can store any kind of data types like integer, string, boolean, undefined, characters, etc.....

We can also create the array as the new object as given below:
let names2 = new Array(1,2,3,4,'json',undefined);
        console.log(names2[4]);

  let names2 = new Array(1,8,90,4,'json',undefined);
        console.log(names2);  
        names2 = names2.sort(); // this is the way of sorting an array
        console.log(names2.length); // this returns the number of elements in the array.
        console.log(names2);


Adding and removing elements in an array.
 // // Way of adding an element in the array which is already declared
        // names2.push("This is a pushed element");
        // console.log(names2);


Accessing objects:
  let employee = {
            name: "string",
            salary : 10,
            channel:"codeSon",
            channel2: "programmingSon",
            // If we want add spaces to the variables of the object we need to put the key inside the braces as given below
            "channel 2": "programmingisimp"

            // In the console to access the above items 
            // we can type employee.name to access the name because the key 'name' doesn't have any spaces but employee['channel 2'] is recommended to access for any kind of key values.


Creating array container:
 let names = new Array(23,45); This is an array with two elements 23 and 45,
 let names = new Array(23) is an array which contains 23 elements which is undefined initially until the element is given
