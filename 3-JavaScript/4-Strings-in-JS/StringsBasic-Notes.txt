Way of Creating template using variables.
var string = "This";
        var name = "Newson";
        var channel = "web";
        var msg = "He is Learning web development";
        var temp = ` ${name} is a student and he is learning ${channel}`;
        console.log(temp);

after using the ` ` instead of '' and "" we don't get errors inside the variable while we use '' or "" inside the variable template. 

Getting length of any variable
   console.log(temp);
        var len = name.length;
        console.log(`Length of name is `+len);
\n creates new line escaping the initial line

Using this method given below, we can add html elements dynamically to DOM:
document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = " <h3> This is an h3 heading </h3>"

The inner html will be added to the html whose id is "content" , so from basic we need to have good commands over strings in JavaScript.
