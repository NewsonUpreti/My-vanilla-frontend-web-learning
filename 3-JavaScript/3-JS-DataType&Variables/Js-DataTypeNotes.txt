Initializing variables:
variable declaration using dynamic typing(no need to give the type)
var a = 20;
var b = " newson"

Operators in JS:
1) Unary Operator- It has single operand (-8), or (x = -x)
2) Binary Operator.
   Operands - Entities in which Operator operates.

In 2+5, 2 and 3 are operands and + is the Operator

Binary operators:
-- It has two operands (a+b) or(x = x+6)


same as java concatenating to print..
    var num1 = 20;
        var num2 = 30;
        console.log(" The sum of num1 and num2 is "+(num1+num2));
        num1 ** num2 gives value of 20 to the power 30. 
        increment and decrement same as c and java.
