Functions are the building block that operates the task which is assigned to it by the code.

let thename = "JSon ";
let thename1 = "aSon ";
let thename2 = "bSon ";
let thename3 = "cSon ";
let thename4 = "gSon ";

console.log(thename + "is good");
console.log(thename1 + "is good");
console.log(thename2 + "is good");
console.log(thename3 + "is good");
console.log(thename4 + "is good");

// Instead of doing the above long codes, we can create a function which can do the task when called 
function greet(anyname){
    console.log(anyname + "is a good man");
}
let thename = "JSon ";
let thename1 = "aSon ";
let thename2 = "bSon ";
let thename3 = "cSon ";
let thename4 = "gSon ";

greet(thename);
greet(thename3);
