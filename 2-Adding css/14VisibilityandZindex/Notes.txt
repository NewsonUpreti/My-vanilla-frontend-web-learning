useful shortcut:
if we type div.box#box$*10 it will create 10 different divs with box class and id will be box1 box2 box3 and so on.

while using the color and backcolors we can give the visibility to it while styling it. the default visibility value is :visible;
visibility: hidden; will hide the content but the space it covered will be seen blank but not replaced by other content. whereas if we use the tag like display: none; it won't be displayed in the entire webpage and it will be replaced by the following content 

Note: z-index doesn't work in the default positioning or static position of the content
Z-index is used to specify which one content should be visible when it is overlapped while using the position like relative

z-index is used to specify the stacking position while they are overlapped or used over other content and areas
The higher the z-index value the ahead it comes from the lower ones.
for example the z-index of cheese is higher than the z-index of the pizza dough that's it. z-index is widely used during the time of responsive websites, social media apps and so on in order to stack the contents properly when required
