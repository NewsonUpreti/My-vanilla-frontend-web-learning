while using div p { styling here } the direct and indirect all the paragraphs will get the modification inside the div.

while using 
div li p{
            color: lightcoral;
            background-color: black;
            font-weight: normal;
        }
         In the above case the css will be applied to all of the paragraph of the li inside the div tag and  */

but if we want to apply direct css to the paragraphs and any other contents. 

div > p { styling here }    This method will add CSS to only the paragaph which is directly located inside the div.

div + p{ styling here} In this case, the paragraph whose last sibling is div will get the styles given inside the code section.
