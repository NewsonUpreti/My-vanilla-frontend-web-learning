Media Queries:
-- When the screen is resized, specific CSS needs to be injected inside the webpage as given below
@media(max-width:300px) /*max-width:400 means from 0px to 400px the following css will be active in the website */
    {
        #box-1{
            display:block;
        }
    }
    @media (max-width:500px) and (min-width:300px)
    {
        #box-2{
            display: block;
            background-color: aquamarine;

        }
    }
    ::Media queries are fired as soon as the conditions are true. 

    media types in css:
     @media only screen and (max-width:500px)
In the above statement, only screen means just simplifying to process that the css should be used for the only screen contents.
