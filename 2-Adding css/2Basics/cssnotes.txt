Selectors in css:
 CSS selectors are used to find the element whose property will be set.
Selectors are used to target the html elements
Selectors make it easy for us to easily target single/multiple HTML elements in the markup

Types of selectors:
-- element selector
-- id selector
-- class selector
-- the CSS grouping selector

if the class is blue we add css by name .blue and design over it and if the id is blue we add css by #blue and apply design where Id is specially used for single elements whereas class is for multiple elements like stuffs
in the grouping selector we use comma and add all selectors name like span,footer and apply design in it
