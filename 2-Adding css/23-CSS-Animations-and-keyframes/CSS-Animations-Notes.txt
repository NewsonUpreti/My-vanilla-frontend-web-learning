KeyFrames and animations

In order to use the animation property we need to provide the animation name inside the main styling of any items which looks like this as given below
.box{
    background-color: aquamarine;
    border-radius: 0px 100px 100px 0px;
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
    position: relative;
    animation-name: new1;
    animation-duration: 0.5s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
@keyframes new1{
    from{
width: 200px;
    }
    to{
width: 600px;
    }
}

 animation-fill-mode: forwards;
 above code wil fill start the animation and pause at its highest forwared or to{ } condition and backwards will end at the from position.
 animation-fill-mode: alternate; This will end the animation once to{} is reached and comes to initial point again

 animation-timing-function: ease-in or ease-out or ease-in-out; -- This will control the flow of the animation.

 Basic animation properties syntax are given below
 .box{
    background-color: aquamarine;
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
    position: relative;
    animation-name: new1;
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-fill-mode: backwards;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
    animation-delay:3s;
}
@keyframes new1{
    from{
width: 200px;
    }
    to{
width: 1000px;
    }


shorthand for animation properties:
animation: animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function animation-delay animation-iteration-count animation-fill-mode
